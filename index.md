## About
(01. 2018) Central Saint Martins’ MA Graphic Communication Design have spent the last six months developing a thought process behind a particular stream of work. Arriving at the point where this development will be used to springboard into the creation of the work itself, MA GCD presents ‘Graphically Speaking’ — a ‘Work in Progress’ show highlighting the formation and development of these ideas.

Graphically Speaking published these ideas via live audio interviews of each class member, that ran as a live broadcast from Central Saint Martins for the duration of the show.

As part of the physical show, the audience were invited to listen to the broadcast, whilst individual digital visualisations were played and a revolving installation of objects were uncovered simultaneously in the space. The audio was broadcast live and archived online (see 'Schedule').

As part of the WIP show, we are not emphasising final work(s) but the discussion of our ideas and the diversity of both the nature of Communication Design and the group itself. Graphically speaking.
