## About
(01. 2018) Central Saint Martinsâ€™ [MA Graphic Communication Design](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/communication-and-graphic-design/postgraduate/ma-graphic-communication-design-csm){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} have spent the last six months developing a thought process behind a particular stream of work. Arriving at the point where this development will be used to springboard into the creation of the work itself, MA GCD presents _Graphically Speaking_ â€” a â€˜Work in Progressâ€™ show highlighting the formation and development of these ideas.

(02. 2018) _Graphically Speaking_ published these ideas via live audio interviews of each class member, running as a live broadcast from Central Saint Martins (accessible in-person and online) for the duration of the show.

[As part of the physical show](){:class="object-scatter" data-object-scatter-target=".object-scatter-items-1" data-barba-prevent="self"} the audience were invited to listen to the broadcast whilst individual graphical visualisations played (responding to the intervieweeâ€™s voice), and a revolving installation of objects relating to each interview were uncovered simultaneously in the space. The audio was broadcast live from the GCD studios in Central Saint Martins and archived online.

As part of the WIP show, the emphasis was not on the final work(s) themselves but the discussion of the ideas being worked through and on diversity â€“ both of the nature of Communication Design and of the group itself.

_â€˜Graphically Speakingâ€™_.
